# Projects and Endeavours


## Unit 1:
#### Discussion Topic: Critically evaluate the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IOT), in the context of the article by Huxley et al (2020), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection.

#### This was the first individual work that enabled us to point out the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges in relation with the data collection process. After anally examining the Lecturecast and other literature, most relevant to the topic, I managed to contribute to the discussion as follows. Following the completion of this task, I received an immense amount of information regarding the data collection process (opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges) which will present to be a very significant skill for my career afterwards, as a data scientist in which I will have to be capable of retrieving, handling large quantities of data and managing to take the correct data-driven decisions.


## Unit 2:
#### Considering what you have now learned in Units 1 and 2, you should respond to at least three of your peers' contributions from the Collaborative Discussion 1. To guide you, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department's page (Group/Teamwork).

#### In exploring the obligations of my master’s degree, I was called to process information provided by my peers and submit specific notes as to promote their improvement in terms of the accuracy of their written work. Additionally, in relation to the promotion of the accuracy of their work, I inherently as a response to an assignment, formulated specific questions in order to promote the retrieval of missed information produced in their written work.This specific occurrence served as the first time I attempted to interact with my peers in a written manner with previously formulated content. It is important to mention that these individuals were chosen to be my teammates in a group project in the Units 6 and 11 within the module.  Within the aforementioned process, I read the essays of my fellow peers, and after careful consideration of their work, I formulated replies in a manner that promoted the expression of my own thoughts as for the adjustment of their content for their improvement of their written content, whilst also inherently producing questions as to allow for the clarification of certain aspects unexplored within their work. 


## Unit 3:
#### In this third and final week of your first discussion, you should provide a summary post based on your initial post, the feedback from your peers and the content of Units 1, 2 and 3. Please label this as ‘Summary Post’. It should be 300 words

#### Within the implications of enacting in unit 3, I was called to gather information from both units, one and two, as to provide a summary post in regards to the posting of my initial post in unit 1 the feedback from my peers in unit 2 and lastly the implementation of the content provided in the previous and current units.The objective of the specific assignment contributed to a well-rounded understanding of the matter at hand and as such gave me the material necessary to relay information about this topic.


## Unit 4:
#### Completion of the Data Management Pipeline Test.
[unit 4.pdf](https://github.com/CKyriacou1/ckyriacou1.github.io/files/10208478/unit.4.pdf)




 




#### This specific unit obligated my person to complete the data management pipeline test, which was automatically marked with its completion.This test enabled us to notice certain weaknesses in the knowledge obtained by the collective student unit, with regards to individual testing in the Data Management Pipeline. A Data Management Pipeline is a way of transporting data from one place (the source) to a destination (such as a data warehouse). During this procedure, the data is transformed and optimized so that it can be used to draw subsequent conclusions. More specifically the Data Management Pipeline consists of the following steps: 
##### 1)Capturing raw data (The extraction of data from primary sources where data is kept or used)
##### 2)Data cleaning (Checking data source, parsing, removing of duplicated and redundancies, data scraping, capture header information to enable logical and semantically relevant processing of data )
##### 3)Data integration (Is the process of gathering data from different sources and fit them together)
##### 4)Database design (It is the procedure of designing data models using a database management system)
##### 5)Data analysis (The process of analyzing the data to reach to obtain the correct conclusions)
##### 6)Data Visualization( It is the procedure of representing data in a graphical form which is more understandable by the user)



## Unit 5:
#### The implications of in acting with the materials given in unit 5, have been conditioned to be the practical application of data cleaning, allocating python examples in accordance with data taken from household-level surveys carried out by UNICEF.As per enacting within the 5th unit, it becomes apparent that the subject at hand is the practice of data cleaning. Data cleaning can be defined as the process by which we formulate our data in a dataset in such a way that we fix or remove each data that is incorrect, incomplete, remove duplicates and filter unwanted outliers as well. Additionally, this procedure ensures that the dataset contains only accurate information. Therefore, this unit aided my person in expanding my knowledge in data cleaning and comprehend how I can practically implement the data cleaning techniques using Python examples.



## Unit 6:
#### For the first part of your assessment, you are advised to position yourself and your team as IT Software Consultants and Developers. You have been commissioned to design and build a single logical database. You get to choose the application environment (and hence the client profile), and it is recommended that you choose an area of interest in a work environment or public service. This could be the postal service, retail industry/customer service, transport system, security services or the floral industry.

#### Once you have confirmed your design, you are required to develop the database and present an executive summary to the senior management team, describing how it meets their requirements.

#### Your team is expected to prepare and deliver a design report of your intended development work for the organisation. Please refer to the Lecturecast in this unit for guidance. Your design should capture the following. Please Note: The associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the Grading Criteria (in Module Resources).

#### Logical design - data items/entities, attributes of the data items chosen, relationships and associations. Identify and explain the data types used and data formats selected.
#### Critically evaluate the data management pipeline process with regards to discussing the capturing of the data used and detailing its source, documenting how you implemented data cleaning techniques and the stages that have been carried out during the cleaning process.
#### Produce a proposal of the database build, creating an intended database model design. You should propose a database management system that you will be using for the build, taking into account the requirements of storage, user access, and the manipulation and retrieval of data within the proposed database.
#### Presentation and Structure of your work (weighted at 25%) includes spelling, style, evidence of proofreading, correct use (and format) of citations and references.
#### Appendices should not be used to extend the core report as reports should stand alone, complete and concise, without the appendices. They should really only be used if required, and only for supplementary and/ or supporting information. One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity.

#### In this unit my person had the opportunity to be allocated in a unit regarding the project, allowing for my person to cooperate with Panagiotis and Tsitsi as to achieve the execution of this project. The project topic was to design and build a single logical database in an area of our preference. My responsibility was the first part of the project in which I manage to create the logical design of the database (data items/entities, attributes of the data items chosen, relationships and associations).Apart from the knowledge gained regarding the project’s subject, the entity of my team was able to develop skills such as cooperation, communication, and organization. These values are regarded as the epitome of a well-trained and professional individual within the workplace, as such it is applicable to mention that these skills aid an individual to achieve success within a unit in the workplace.
